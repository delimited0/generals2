# Generals IO Python Bot - TNT  (Working On It)

It is a bot for the [generals.io](http://bot.generals.io) 

## Why call it TNT

In the start of game, conquer more lands and conquer faster will get a big advantage. Just like a bomb, exexplosion in a very short time. So I named it TNT.

## Plan

I believe `Neural networks` and `Deep learning` will make the bot better and marter. So they are in the plan too. 


## How To:
0. requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
0. set the `USER_ID, USER_NAME, GAME_ID (for custom game)` in **config.py.example**  (as for how to get USER_ID of generals io, you can visit dev.generals.io)
1. and rename it to `config.py`
1. choose the bot, for example `python bot_TNT.py`
